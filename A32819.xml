            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Now it is farther obſervable of their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues; That they were built in High places of their Cities, and higher than their own houſes.</p>
               <p>That out of reverence to them, none were ſuffered to make them Thorow-fares, or to uſe them for common matters.</p>
               <p>That in every <hi>Synagogue</hi> was an <hi>ark</hi> or <hi>cheſt,</hi> wherein they laid the <hi>book,</hi> in reſemblance of the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That, when they prayed, they turned their faces towards that <hi>Ark,</hi> as a monitory ſign of the <hi>Ark of God,</hi> and his <hi>dwelling between the Cherubims.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they had appointed Officers, Chief Rulers, Scribes, and Miniſters, anſwering to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97334:17"/> the High-Prieſt, Prieſts, and Porters in the Temple.</p>
               <p>That men and women were diſtinguiſhed in their ranks and ſeats in the Temple. And,</p>
               <p>That the Scriptures were read there, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sections,<note place="margin">Act. 15.21.</note> every Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>Theſe are points commonly acknowledged by the Jewiſh Antiquaries; and yet is not the building of Synagogues, or the ordering of God's ſervice in them, at any time blamed by our Saviour,<note place="margin">S. Luk 4.16, 20.</note> or his Apoſtles; nay, we find them frequenting of them, and conforming to them. It was our B.

                  <hi>Catech.</hi> p. 45. <q>[It is true, in the <hi>obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>poſitive inſtitutions,</hi> we may have regard unto <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> of <hi>prudence,</hi> as to <hi>times, places,</hi> and <hi>ſeaſons,</hi> that by no inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency or miſcarriage of ours, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage taken by the adverſaries of truth, the

               <p>[p. 61.62. <q>Whatever is of <hi>circumſtance</hi> in the manner of it's performance, (<hi>viz.</hi> of Religious Worſhip) not capable of eſpecial determination, as emerging, or ariſing only occaſionally upon the doing of that which is appointed, at this or that time, in this or that place, and the like, is left unto the rule of <hi>moral prudence,</hi>— but the <hi>ſuper-addition</hi> of <hi>ceremonies,</hi> neceſſarily belonging neither to the inſtitutions of worſhip, nor unto thoſe <hi>circumſtances,</hi> whoſe diſpoſal falls under the rule of <hi>moral prudence,</hi> neither doth nor can add any thing to the due <hi>order</hi> of Goſpel Worſhip.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now the allowance of any thing (be it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly time and place, and the like) is the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and death of this <hi>general principle,</hi> 
                  <q>That every thing relating to Divine Worſhip, muſt have a <hi>command</hi> or <hi>inſtitution</hi> in the Scripture, and that nothing may be done in, or about Gods ſervice, which is not ſo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted.</q> But the truth is, <hi>Moral prudence,</hi> is a word of <hi>vaſt extent,</hi> and opens a door wide enough for any thing pleaded for by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to crowd in at. For it were worth the knowing, <q>Why preſcribed Forms of Liturgy, and Habits, and Geſtures, no-where determined in Scripture, fall not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97334:29"/> under the reach of <hi>Moral prudence</hi>'s Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as well as the circumſtances of time and place; or why publick <hi>prudence</hi> may not be allowed to interpoſe in thoſe things which a private prudence may determine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now for his vvay of evading the obligation of ſome things granted to be of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;</p>
               <p>[<hi>Catech.</hi> p. 50, 51, 52. <q>Mention is made in the Scriptures of ſundry things practiſed by the Lord Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which, being then in common uſe amongſt men, were occaſionally made by them <hi>Symbolical inſtructions</hi> in <hi>moral duties.</hi> Such were, <hi>waſhing</hi> of <hi>feet</hi> by one another, the <hi>holy kiſs,</hi> and the like; But there being no more in them, but a ſanctified uſe directed unto the preſent civil cuſtoms and uſages, the <hi>commands</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven concerning them, reſpect not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, nor appointed any continuance of them, being particularly ſuited unto the ſtate of things, and perſons in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;</q> as <hi>John</hi> 13.12, 13, 14, 15. <q>After he had waſhed their feet, and had taken his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and was ſet down again, he ſaid unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? ye call me Maſter, and Lord, and ye ſay well, for ſo I am; If I then your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers feet, for I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you.

               </p>
               <p>Now in the explication of theſe Anſwers, the Catechiſt declares,</p>
               <p>Firſt, What Church he treats of;<note place="margin">p. 90.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Not the Catholick Church of Elect Believers, nor the univerſality of Profeſſors of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; but particular Churches, and theſe particular Churches,<note place="margin">p. 91.</note> as oppoſed unto a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church.]</q>

               <p>Thoſe <hi>proofs</hi> then, which relate to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> which is the body of Chriſt, are not to be <hi>reduced</hi> unto this <hi>matter.</hi> Such as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16. inſiſted on by him, <hi>p.</hi> 115. and elſewhere.<note place="margin">p. 115.</note>

               <p>Secondly, His next work is, to prove, and demonſtrate, <q>That ſuch <hi>particular</hi> Churches are themſelves an <hi>ordinance</hi> of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> inſtituted, and appointed by Chriſt.</q> And his proofs are theſe;</p>

                  <q>That this could not be the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>None, I preſume, will deny, but that <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſocieties</hi> of Chriſtians, were <hi>intended,</hi> and are <hi>approved</hi> by Chriſt: the only queſtion is, of ſuch <hi>particular, gathered,</hi> and <hi>covenanting-Churches,</hi> as the Catechiſt treats of; and the onely thing I here examine, is, the <hi>pertinencie</hi> of his proofs for ſuch. And the truth is, <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Churches are indeed here <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> by Chriſt, but not in <hi>this place</hi> inſtituted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. <hi>Approved</hi> and <hi>allowed</hi> here they are, but not here <hi>appointed;</hi> but then, this cannot be here inferr'd <hi>convincingly,</hi> neither from the

               <p>I deſign not here a laborious confutation, intending a poſitive confirmation of the truth to follow in the cloſe; it ſhall ſuffice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to note, That the <hi>Catechiſt</hi> hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his own <hi>diſtinction,</hi> between the Catholick <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God's elect,</hi> and <hi>particular Churches</hi> or ſocieties of Chriſtians, when he thus makes the <hi>qualification</hi> of the former (whereof yet he warned us to take notice, that he did not <hi>treat</hi>) as neceſſary unto the <hi>later;</hi> and I will only ſet him againſt himſelf, it being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>falſhood</hi> uſually to <hi>confute</hi> it ſelf.

               <p>In the general, That the practiſe of a thing in the worſhip of God, under the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is not any better evidence for Chriſt's <hi>inſtitution,</hi> than the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> and that we have only his <hi>bare word</hi> for it, that the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> ceremonies and ſolemnities of this <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> were peculiar to that people, and the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it <hi>common</hi> alſo unto us.</p>

               <p>Now, if thus much would ſerve the turn, the <hi>Baptiſmal covenant</hi> included in the very profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> we require it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly at the entrance of every member into the <hi>Church;</hi> the ſolemn uttering of it, with his own mouth, as the Oath of <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> unto Chriſt, if he be of years of diſcretion; or, however, the expreſs owning of what was anſwer'd in his name, when bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed

               <argument>
                  <p>A Scripture-account given of the Chriſtian Church. Chriſt ſpeaks of it as afterwards to be built. The power of planting, and building it, to whom, and when given. The beginnings of this Church left by Chriſt. The ſtory of its firſt building by St. <hi>Peter, Act. 2.</hi> Baptiſm upon Profeſſion, the door of entrance. The practiſe after admiſſion. The Chriſtian-Church defined. Of <hi>Churches,</hi> as many; and <hi>Church,</hi> as one. The neceſſary qualification of Church-members. The viſible Church, a communion of Profeſſors wherein are good and bad, Saints and Hypocrites are mixed together. The Miniſter's unworthineſs nulls not the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Divine Ordinances, The preſence of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97334:69"/> evil members in Church-communion, hurts not thoſe who conſent not to their ſins and impieties.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe word <hi>Church,</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> imports chiefly, the <hi>Society of Chriſtians; i. e. Believers</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> already come.<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Pearſon</hi> on the <hi>Creed.</hi> Artic. 9.</note> And it is (in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s language, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19, 20.) <q>The houſhold of God, built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner-ſtone.</q> Our B. <hi>Saviour</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Church,</hi> in this ſenſe to his Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> as a thing which was to be; a thing to be after builded, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Rock will I build my Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">St. Matt. 16. 18.</note> Upon the <hi>Rock,</hi> confeſſed by him, <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Living God,</hi> principally; and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally too, upon this <hi>Rock,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> one of the twelve foundations of the <hi>Church, (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 21.14.) and, as we ſhall obſerve, in the proceſs of Scripture-ſtory, the firſt <hi>builder</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>The peculiar power of raiſing this <hi>Church,</hi> was given to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> after our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> when he iſſued forth his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to them,<note place="margin">St. Matt. 28. 19, 20.</note> 
                  <q>To go out in his name, and preach the Goſpel among all Nations, and ſo make Diſciples, baptizing them in the name, (and into the acknowledgment) of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them (ſo admitted) to obſerve all things whatſoever he commanded.</q> In our <hi>Creed</hi> therefore, the mention of the <hi>Church</hi> follows the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> made in <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:97334:69"/> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> All the members of this Church, are ſuppoſed to be baptized in the Name of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and this Church is the <hi>univerſal</hi> Society of them who believe in, and worſhip the <hi>Tri-une God,</hi> the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, The <hi>Commiſſion</hi> for <hi>planting</hi> this Church in the world, iſſued forth from our <hi>Saviour</hi> after his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them <q>to preach repentance,<note place="margin">St. Luke 24.</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, in his name, among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, beginning at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to witneſs and teſtifie the Articles of Chriſtian faith, and to incorporate, and embody, all that ſhould believe, into one ſociety, by Baptiſm; But he commands them expreſly to tarry in the city of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">verſ. 47, 48, 49.</note> till they were endued with power from on high, till they received the promiſed gift of the Holy Ghoſt, to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie them with extraordinary abilities for this work committed to them, that the Spirit might accompany them in the world as <hi>Chriſt's advocate.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now all the remarkable Actions we read among the Apoſtles, after Chriſt's <hi>aſcenſion,</hi> till the pouring forth of the Spirit, was, only the choice of a <hi>ſubſtitute</hi> among themſelves, in the room of <hi>Judas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 1.28.</note> that fell by his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to compleat their number; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, we read, <q>
                     <hi>Matthias</hi> was choſen by lot, to take part of the Miniſtry and Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them, and he was numbred with the eleven Apoſtles.<note place="margin">ver. 15.</note> And the number of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97334:70"/> names together there aſſembled, Apoſtles and Diſciples, left by Chriſt, were about an<note n="†" place="margin">Not that theſe were all that were then belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, (for we read of above 500 brethren at once, 1 Cor. 15.6. to whom Chriſt appeared after his Reſurrection) but all at that time aſſembled.</note> hundred and twenty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This then was the <hi>beginning</hi> of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, left by Chriſt; now the firſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable building,</hi> and <hi>encreaſe</hi> of this Church, we have an account of, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>After that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> deſcended on them at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſt's <hi>promiſe,</hi> (whence the mention of the Church, planted by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> fitly comes in our <hi>Creed,</hi> immediately after the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> of the <hi>Holy G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now, This three thouſand, added to the remnant left by Chriſt, upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, are the firſt <hi>ſociety</hi> that we read expreſly call'd a Church in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> So they are call'd, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. and we read not of any ſo call'd before them.</p>
               <p>Here then is the <q>beginning of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, the ſociety of thoſe that believe in Jeſus Chriſt, conceived by the H. Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c.</q> which was the prime <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the Society of theſe <hi>baptized believers.</hi> Nor can a truer account be given of the Chriſtian Church, than
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97334:70"/> by peruſing diligently this <hi>ſtory,</hi> where we have a clear deſcription of,</p>
               <p>The <hi>entrance</hi> of theſe three thouſand into the Church. And,</p>
               <p>Their <hi>practice</hi> after that <hi>entrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſum is this:</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> firſt preaches, and the ſubſtance of his Sermon is, the Doctrine concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the point of <hi>Repentance, Faith</hi> and <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> adviſing all that believed, embraced, and would profeſs this Doctrine, to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. And this was the <hi>door</hi> of their <hi>entrance</hi> into the Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. <q>Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized, and the ſame day there were added unto them, (that is, to the 120) about 3000 ſouls.</q> 
                  <hi>Baptiſm</hi> upon a profeſſion of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> was their <hi>entrance</hi> into the Church.</p>
               <p>Now then, their <hi>demeanour,</hi> being ſo <hi>enter'd</hi> and admitted, follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 42.44. <q>They continued ſtedfaſtly, and that together, in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</q> They perſevered in hearing the Apoſtles <hi>teach,</hi> in obſerving the <hi>orders</hi> of their ſociety, and all mutual <hi>offices</hi> of <hi>charity,</hi> in <hi>eating</hi> the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and <hi>praying together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that here we are ſufficiently reſolved about the Chriſtian <hi>Church,</hi> namely, <q>That it is a viſible company of perſons thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and thus continuing, being once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</q> And this is the Church which was <hi>daily encreaſed</hi> afterwards, and is to be <hi>preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and <hi>encreaſed</hi> to the end of the world, by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97334:71"/> the continued <hi>addition</hi> and <hi>acceſſions</hi> of other <hi>perſons</hi> received into <hi>it,</hi> upon the <hi>ſame</hi> terms, by the <hi>ſame door</hi> of <hi>entrance,</hi> and demeaning themſelves, being entred, after the <hi>ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Of theſe 3000, it is ſaid, they were <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Diſciples,</hi> left by Chriſt, ver. 41. And, <q>To this Church the Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved, verſe 47.</q> And this is the Church, which our B. <hi>Saviour</hi> promiſed to ſet up, and uphold for ever in the world, <q>and that the gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt it. St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Society of profeſſing penitents and believers, baptized into the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating together in the Apoſtolical Doctrine, Diſcipline, Sacraments, and Devotions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Society</hi> afterwards increaſing, by the great multitude of <hi>believers,</hi> was, of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be <hi>ſub-divided</hi> into certain <hi>particulars,</hi> for the performing of <hi>joynt-ſervice</hi> to God, in an <hi>orderly communion;</hi> as accordingly it was by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> authority and direction. And that is the ground, why we ſometimes read of <hi>Church,</hi> in the <hi>ſingular</hi> number, as of <hi>one;</hi> and ſometimes again of <hi>Churches,</hi> as of <hi>many.</hi> I will declare this matter ſomewhat more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
               <p>Sometimes we read of <hi>Churches,</hi> as <hi>many.</hi> 
                  <q>They went through the Cities,<note place="margin">Act. 16.4, 5.</note> and deliver'd the decrees of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to be kept, and ſo were the Churches eſtabliſhed in the faith, and increaſed in number daily.—<note place="margin">Rom. 16 14.</note> All the Churches of the Gentiles.—<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14 33.</note> All the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

               <p>Theſe Countries, through the ſucceſsful preaching of the Goſpel, had many <hi>particular</hi> Churches, or congregations of the <hi>faithful,</hi> united under ſome <hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Biſhop;</hi> the leſſer <hi>congregations</hi> under ſome inferiour <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> And thus we read of a few <hi>believers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened together in the houſe of one <hi>ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> as a <hi>Church.</hi>

                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:97334:72"/>

                  </q> And thus, in like manner, we read of other <hi>great Cities,</hi> though there were many <hi>particular,</hi> and <hi>leſſer</hi> Churches, in them, and the adjacent parts belonging to them, yet are they mention'd ſtill but as <hi>one</hi> Church.

                  <q>[God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and truth.]</q> It is this <hi>Chriſtian worſhip,</hi> which he is eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with, as moſt <hi>ſuitable</hi> to himſelf; nor indeed, was he ever pleaſed with any <hi>meer bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily worſhip, principally,</hi> or <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>for it ſelf.</hi> He will have our <hi>ſouls</hi> joyned to our <hi>external performances,</hi> and be worſhipped after that <hi>way</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> which anſwers to the fore-going <hi>types</hi> and <hi>ſhadows. i. e.</hi> after the Chriſtian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by Chriſt revealed.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97334:78"/> was the <hi>motive</hi> to <hi>David</hi>'s great <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> 
                  <q>The work, ſaith he, is Great,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.1, 2.</note> for the palace is not for men, but for the Lord.

               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Scripture-precepts</hi> of <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to God's <hi>houſe</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> have no <hi>ſign</hi> at all in them, of being <hi>ceremonial</hi> onely;<note place="margin">Levit. 19.30.26.2. Eccleſ. 5.12</note> for they are ever urged with that moral <hi>reaſon</hi> of their <hi>relation</hi> unto God. The Catechiſt, I remember, ſaith.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[Whilſt the <hi>meer inſtitutions</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> continued,<note place="margin">Cat. p. 14.</note> God enforced them vvith <hi>moral reaſons,</hi> as his ovvn <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>authority;</hi> but thoſe <hi>reaſons</hi> prove not any of thoſe <hi>inſtitutions</hi> to be <hi>moral,</hi> unleſs they enſue upon thoſe <hi>reaſons</hi> alone, and are no vvhere elſe commanded; for, being once <hi>inſtituted</hi> and <hi>commanded,</hi> they are to be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced</hi> with <hi>moral conſiderations,</hi> taken from

               </p>
               <p>Now this being granted, I ſee not, why <hi>[Ye ſhall reverence my Sanctuary]</hi> be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a <hi>moral inſtitution;</hi> much <hi>rather</hi> than <hi>[Ye ſhall keep my Sabbaths]</hi> linked in the ſame verſe vvith it, vvhereof, I ſuppoſe, the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſt</hi> and his <hi>party</hi> make no doubt; inaſmuch as <q>the keeping God's Sabbaths is elſevvhere commanded,<note place="margin">Exod 11.23, 24.</note> upon poſitive, and particular grounds, and the Sabbath dayes are expreſly reckon'd by the Apoſtle, as a ſhadovv of things to come, not obliging unto Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. But the <hi>reverencing</hi> of Gods houſe, or ſanctuary, is no vvhere command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vvithout an intimation of this moral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its relation unto God, nor doth the Apoſtle account the Temple among thoſe ceremonies which he there enumerates.</q> The <hi>Jews,</hi> certainly, as they did, upon principles of <hi>equity,</hi> build their <hi>Synagogues</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of ſerving God in their particular Cities, ſo did they in like manner, call them, <hi>houſes of God,</hi> and <q>rationally argue, from the precepts of reverence due to God's Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, a proportionable reverence due to theſe, vvriting over the doors, <hi>Haec eſt porta Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> This is the gate of the Lord;</q> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all <hi>rudeneſſes,</hi> and <hi>profanations</hi> of them, as hath been before declared,<note place="margin">Ch. 4. p. 26.</note> in the <hi>firſt part</hi> of this diſcourſe.<note place="margin">St. Luke 7.</note> The <hi>Centurion,</hi> we knovv, is commended in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> unto Chriſt, for having given an excellent demonſtration of love to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation by building of a

                  <hi>Synagogue.</hi> What then are they, but <hi>haters</hi> of their <hi>country,</hi> who, inſtead of <hi>building,</hi> ſeek to <hi>demoliſh</hi> the <hi>Houſes of God</hi> in the land, or make no difference between them and <hi>common ſtructures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It may deſervedly weigh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to behold our B.

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Probable it is, that, even in the times of the <hi>firſt Chriſtians,</hi> (in that their perſecuted eſtate, and wilderneſs-condition) they yet <hi>did,</hi> as they were <hi>able, ſet apart</hi> certain <hi>places,</hi> as peculiar for their <hi>common meeting</hi> together, to <hi>ſerve God</hi> in.

               </p>
               <p>The neceſſity of <hi>government</hi> it ſelf in the Church, is here well ſuppoſed, in that the Church is call'd <q>[a Spiritual Incorporation of perſons, under Rule, Government, or Diſcipline.]</q> This therefore, in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is rightly ſaid to be evident from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing it ſelf,</hi>

               <p>As to the diſtinction of Church-<hi>officers</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>ordinary,</hi> it ought to have been manifeſted out of the Holy Scriptures; vvherein, 'tis moſt certain, that vve read of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> diſtinctly, and by name; but not a vvord, that the chief and ſubſtantial part of their <hi>office</hi> and <hi>power</hi> vvas <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and for a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> only.

               <p>And then, in the laſt place, as a farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that there is a <hi>preheminence</hi> included in this name of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> we may take notice, that in three of thoſe Scriptures <hi>Biſhops</hi> are joyned with <hi>Deacons,</hi> as the Catechiſt alſo notes; and moſt undoubtedly theſe their <hi>Deacons</hi> were not of <hi>equal</hi> degree with them. <hi>Deacons,</hi> in the Chriſtian <hi>Church,</hi> are known to have been <q>ſuch as attended, and waited on the Biſhop, and did what he appointed them.</q> But of theſe, we are to diſcourſe more afterwards.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97334:91"/> conſider of the thing it ſelf, and in that too, he is no leſs peremptory.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[Neither is there any mention,<note place="margin">Cat. p 122.</note> in any place of Scripture, of any ſuch <hi>preheminence</hi> of one ſort of theſe <hi>Church-officers,</hi> or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, over another; not in particular, where the Officers of the Church are in an eſpecial manner enumerated; as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.5, 6, 7, 8. Nor is there any mention of any <hi>ſpecial office</hi> that ſhould be peculiar unto ſuch Officers.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The diſtinct mention of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> under them, is a ſufficient confutation unto this. Add hereunto, what is evident of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> What ſaith the <hi>Catechiſt</hi> unto them?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[As for what is pleaded by ſome,<note place="margin">Cat. p. 123.</note> from the <hi>example</hi> of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> it is ſaid, That when any perſons can prove themſelves to be <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. to be called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>office</hi> by antecedent <hi>prophecie,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. and to be ſent by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and in an eſpecial manner to be directed by them, in ſome employment, for a ſeaſon, which they are not ordinarily to attend unto, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. and 3.12. It will be granted, that they have another <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>office</hi> committed unto them, than thoſe who are only <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> in the Scripture.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here, the <hi>cauſe,</hi> if we mark it well, is fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded. <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have had a <hi>preheminence</hi> of <hi>authority</hi> over other <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and that by the <hi>Apoſtles appointment.</hi> Such <hi>authority</hi> then, is not in it

               <p>That <hi>Timothy</hi> was an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> properly ſo called, is not demonſtrable from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5.

                  <hi>[As my Father ſendeth me, ſo ſend I you] (ſending,</hi> and <hi>giving power,</hi> being <hi>ſent,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving power,</hi> being phraſes of the ſame <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance).</hi> The like <hi>power</hi> is by <hi>Chriſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be inſtated on theſe faithful <hi>Confeſſors</hi> afterward, and that belonging to the <hi>planting</hi> and <hi>propagating</hi> of the Faith among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> bringing them in to <hi>repentance,</hi> (which is the <hi>breaking them to ſhivers</hi> there) and <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with a rod of iron, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Scepter of Chriſt's ſpiritual Kingdom,</hi> his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Paſtoral authority</hi> committed to them.</p>
               <p>But, if this (being by the <hi>prophetick</hi> ſtile wherein it is <hi>veiled,</hi> ſomewhat <hi>obſcure</hi>) bring not that evidence with it which is expected, let it paſs for a <hi>conjecture,</hi> which pretends only to be conſiderable by the <hi>accordance</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> it hath with other <hi>greater</hi> Evidences now to follow.</p>
               <p>To proceed then to the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of thoſe <hi>times,</hi> which are moſt competent to clear the matter of <hi>fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A firſt <hi>evidence</hi> of this ſort, is, the <hi>Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> of <hi>Matthias</hi> into the place of <hi>Judas</hi> the <hi>traditor</hi> and <hi>deſertor, Act.</hi> 1,<note place="margin">Act. 1.20, 22, 25.</note> who loſt his <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and, ſoon after, his <hi>life.</hi> Wherein we ſee St. <hi>Peter,</hi> upon the <hi>prophetical prediction</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s fate, and the laſt branch of that [<hi>his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick let another take</hi>] concludes with a [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] a <hi>neceſſity</hi> that one of thoſe that had <hi>continued</hi> with them from the <hi>beginning,</hi> (and ſo was qualified for it) ſhould become <hi>with them</hi> a <hi>witneſs</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> and by the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97334:98"/> form of their Prayer for God's direction, and revelation of his will, which he had pitch'd on; it is evident, that, <hi>taking his Biſhoprick,</hi> verſe 20. is all one with <hi>taking the lot or portion of that Miniſtry and Apoſtleſhip,</hi> verſe 25.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, it is apparent, Act. 6. that the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Act. 6.</note> to make their burden more ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, did, by <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> create <hi>ſeven Deacons</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which, although it be not an example of their conſtituting <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi> to their <hi>whole Office;</hi> yet, is an evidence that they vvere able to <hi>communicate</hi> to others, <hi>any part</hi> of that povver committed to them by Chriſt. And then, Why they might not in <hi>whole,</hi> as well as in <hi>part,</hi> communicate it unto others, vvho might ſucceed to it (after their <hi>departure</hi> from any <hi>place,</hi> or finally out of the <hi>world</hi>) as vvell as <hi>aſſiſt</hi> them, being <hi>preſent,</hi> by undergoing, in their ſtead, ſome <hi>part</hi> of it, there is no imaginable reaſon to be rendred; but, on the contrary, the <hi>example</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> vvho firſt aſſumed the <hi>ſeventy</hi> to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> him, (and at that time God gave them of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſo part of his <hi>Power</hi>) and after conſtituted <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>ſucceed</hi> him, will be directly applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this matter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, After, and beſide, the inſtituting of <hi>this office,</hi> on the <hi>Twelve;</hi> it was the Will, and Appointment of God,<note place="margin">Act. 13.2.</note> that <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> ſhould be aſſumed to it, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle's death;<note place="margin">ch. 12.2.</note> in the ſame manner as <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes</hi> ſupplied the place of <hi>Joſeph</hi> when he dyed.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:97334:98"/>
               <p>Fourthly, By comparing ſome paſſages of Scripture with the plain aſſertions of <hi>antient Writers,</hi> and <hi>Fathers of the Church,</hi> it may be concluded, that <hi>James the juſt,</hi> that had the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Brother of the Lord,</hi> was conſtituted <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (being none of thoſe twelve <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) by Chriſt himſelf, ſay ſome,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theophyl.</hi> in 1 Cor. 15.7.</note> at his appearing to him after the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> but (as it is more generally reſolved on) by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which received their power from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that in the 19th year of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius, i. e.</hi> the next year after the death of Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Chronicle.</hi> Hence it is, that this <hi>James,</hi> though none of the <hi>twelve,</hi> is called an <hi>Apoſtle, Gal.</hi> 1.19. and perhaps, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.6. and 22. and, in the inſcription of his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> he is entitled the <hi>Apoſtle James;</hi> and accordingly,<note place="margin">Com. in Iſai.—</note> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> calls him the <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Apoſtle;</hi> which farther yields him a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority</hi> before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> (as being after him admitted to that <hi>dignity</hi>) to whom he gives the <hi>right hand of fellowſhip,</hi> Gal. 2.9.

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it is not only ſaid by himſelf expreſly, that he had laid hands on <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> and that thereby the gift of God,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1 6. 2 Tim. 4 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> And the ſame is as clear of <hi>Titus,</hi> who is by
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97334:99"/> him <hi>left in</hi> Crete,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>with power of regulating things not yet ordered in that Iſland, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Elders in every Church;</hi> which being two branches of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> power, it is by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi> generally affirmed, that he was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> or <hi>chief Biſhop</hi> of that Iſland, as <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and accordingly, theſe two are ſtiled <hi>Apoſtles</hi> alſo, (as receiving the ſame <hi>power</hi> or <hi>Commiſſion</hi> that Chriſt had given to the <hi>twelve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſſert. 4.</note> and to St. <hi>Paul</hi>) which is obſervable likewiſe of divers others. And accordingly, 'tis the general affirmation of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> 
                  <q>that thoſe who now are called <hi>Biſhops,</hi> were called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;</hi> but, in proceſs of time, they left the name of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to thoſe that were truly ſo, ſent immediately by Chriſt;</q> and impoſed the name of <hi>Biſhops</hi> on thoſe others, that had been antiently call'd <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, It farther appears, that as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were thus <hi>ordained</hi> by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo they had thereby alſo <hi>power</hi> to <hi>ordain</hi> others, through all Churches in thoſe <hi>Regions</hi> where they were placed, and accordingly did <hi>actually ordain</hi> them. And ſo the <hi>power</hi> given the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> was ſure no <hi>temporary power;</hi> but, as from them derived to others, ſo from thoſe others farther communicated: and all this by <hi>expreſs teſtimonies</hi> of Scripture. For, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould leave <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> on purpoſe to <hi>ordain Elders</hi> there, and preſcribe <hi>Timothy</hi> as well as him, What ſort of men, and how <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,</hi> ſhould be conſtituted <hi>Biſhops</hi> (and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>) in the Churches, and they ſhould make
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97334:99"/> 
                  <hi>no uſe</hi> of that <hi>power,</hi> is not imaginable, nor could be controverted, though there were no other book in the <hi>world,</hi> but the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> whereas the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of the following <hi>Church-writers,</hi> is clear, that in (<hi>rete</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> and in <hi>Aſia</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> had the <hi>ordaining</hi> firſt, and then the <hi>judging</hi> of many <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and that as <hi>there,</hi> ſo every where elſe, the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in their ſeveral Churches, were the <hi>ſucceſſors</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and therefore many of them call'd <hi>Apoſtles</hi> alſo, as hath been already intimated. St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>St Hieron.</hi> in Pſ. 45.</note> is poſitive. <hi>Pro patribus Apoſtolis filii Epiſcopi.</hi> For the <hi>Fathers</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> are the <hi>Biſhops</hi> their <hi>Sons.</hi> And again,<note place="margin">Ep. ad <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</hi>

               <p>Seventhly, It is manifeſt, by the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of Chriſt to the <hi>ſeven Churches</hi> of the <hi>Proconſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aſia,</hi> deliver'd by <hi>viſion</hi> to St. <hi>John,</hi> that there were, at the date of that <hi>Epiſtle, Rulers,</hi> or <hi>Governours</hi> of each of thoſe <hi>Churches,</hi> to whom, under the title of <hi>Angels,</hi> the care of thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> was committed. That theſe were any of the <hi>twelve Apoſtles,</hi> or others, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted</hi> from <hi>Heaven immediately,</hi> neither is, nor can be pretended by any. It remains therefore, that it muſt be a <hi>derived, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated power,</hi> whether <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately</hi> from one or more of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that firſt preached the Goſpel there, which was thus veſted in thoſe <hi>Angels;</hi> in reſpect of which, not only that honourable <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97334:100"/> upon each of them by Chriſt himſelf, (the ſame that on the <hi>High-prieſt</hi> among the <hi>Jews, Malach.</hi> 2.7.) but they are alſo reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſo many <hi>ſtarrs</hi> held by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>right hand, Rev.</hi> 1.16. and 2.1. which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible evidence, that this <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of theirs, was <hi>approved</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> by Chriſt. And to ſo clear a teſtimony of <hi>Scripture,</hi> we may farther add the words of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>

               <p>Having cleared the whole matter thus far, there will be now no need to declare what <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> they are, which are thus <hi>conveyed</hi> to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> or <hi>officers</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> it being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy manifeſt, that the power of <hi>planting, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning,</hi> and <hi>continuing</hi> of the <hi>churches,</hi> being firſt veſted in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was, from him derived to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> and ſo that the power of <hi>preaching, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, teaching, confirming, conſecrating</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt, binding</hi> and <hi>looſing, bleſſing</hi> in <hi>marriage, viſiting,</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> over the <hi>ſick,</hi> and at laſt <hi>conſtituting others like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> either in <hi>whole,</hi> by communicating en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely their <hi>whole power</hi> to them, or in <hi>part,</hi> by giving them ſome <hi>limited powers,</hi> for ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>offices,</hi> were thus communicated.

                  <p>The Catechiſt's opinion of the indiſpenſable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Miniſters being choſen by the people, largely declared.

His reaſons ſtrike at the Civil ſtate, no leſs than the Eccleſiaſtical; that there muſt be no Rulers in either, but by the peoples choice. There is no duty required of the people, as to their Officers and Governours, which makes this choice contended for, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Arguments againſt Popular Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as un-conformable to the way of the Old Teſtament, made by incompetent judges, the occaſion of diviſions and factions, reflected on extreamly by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Propheſie, <hi>2 Tim. 4.3, 4.</hi> leaving Miniſters under too great a temptation, to pleaſe and humour the people, and very injurious and dangerous to the concernment of Chriſtian Kings, in the ordering of the publick Religion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.

               <p>THe fore-going Diſcourſe, makes it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to beſtow any farther reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very much of what the Catechiſt next of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, concerning the differences between thoſe whom he calls <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and <hi>ordinary Officers,</hi> or <hi>Rulers</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> Cat. p. 124, 125.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And hence it was, that this <hi>right</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>chuſing</hi> of thoſe who are to be ſet over them, in the vvork of the Lord, was a long time preſerved <hi>inviolate</hi> in the <hi>primitive</hi> Churches, as the <hi>Antients</hi> do abundantly teſtifie. Yea, the ſhew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it, could never be utterly thruſt out of the world, but is ſtill retained in thoſe Churches, which yet reject the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf. And this <hi>inſtitution</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> is ſuited to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of the authority that he hath appointed to abide therein: for, as we have ſhewed before, <hi>perſons</hi> become a <hi>Church</hi> by their own <hi>voluntary conſent.</hi> Chriſt makes his <hi>ſubjects</hi> willing, not <hi>ſlaves.</hi> His <hi>rule</hi> over them, is, by his <hi>Grace</hi> in their <hi>own wills,</hi> and he will have them every way <hi>free</hi> in their obedience. A <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> is an eſtate of abſolute liberty under Chriſt, not for men to do what they will, but for men to do their duty freely without <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.</hi> Now, nothing is more contrary to this <hi>liberty,</hi> than to have their <hi>Guides, Rulers,</hi>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:97334:104"/> and <hi>Overſeers,</hi> impoſed on them without their conſent. Beſides, the body of the Church is obliged to diſcharge its duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt, in every <hi>inſtitution</hi> of his, which herein they cannot, if they have not their free <hi>conſent</hi> in the <hi>choice</hi> of their <hi>Paſtors,</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> but are conſidered as <hi>mute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> or <hi>brute creatures,</hi> Neither is there any other <hi>ordinary</hi> way of <hi>communicating</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority unto any in the Church, but by the voluntary <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> and <hi>ſubjection</hi> of the Church it ſelf unto them. For, as all other imaginable ways may <hi>fail,</hi> and have done ſo, where they have been truſted unto; ſo they are <hi>irrational,</hi> and <hi>unſcriptural,</hi> as to their being a means of the delegation of any <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> whatever.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here then we have the peoples <hi>election</hi> of their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> pleaded for, as an <hi>inſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> plainly expreſſed in the Scripture, <hi>indiſpenſably</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to conſtitute a <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtry,</hi> obſerved <hi>inviolate</hi> in the <hi>primitive Church;</hi> and all other wayes condemned, as <hi>irrational,</hi> and <hi>un-ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural.</hi> Let us therefore, in the firſt place, view the plain, and expreſs Scriptures, that demonſtrate this unto us, which, if they fail the <hi>Catechiſt,</hi> all his other pretended argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> will not ſerve the turn. The Scriptures are two, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and <hi>Act.</hi> 14. ["And in both of them,<note place="margin">Cat. p. 132.</note> he tells us, <q>there is mention of their <hi>election</hi> by the <hi>community</hi> of the Church, and in both of them, the Apoſtles themſelves preſided with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97334:105"/> a <hi>fulneſs</hi> of Church-power, and yet would not deprive the <hi>Churches</hi> of that which was their <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>priviledge.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As to this <hi>election</hi> by the <hi>community</hi> of the Church, ſaid to be mention'd in both theſe places, we ſhall ſee how far it extends upon examination. But if the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preſided at the ſame time, with a fulneſs of Church-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as is here aſſerted; they might certainly have ordered the matter otherwiſe, <q>no Church-power being wanting, where the fulneſs of it is ſuppoſed.</q>— Now to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[The firſt of theſe, is <hi>Acts</hi> 6. where all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> together, to give a <hi>rule</hi> unto the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> proceeding of all <hi>churches</hi> in the <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> of <hi>Officers</hi> among them, do appoint the <hi>multitude</hi> of the Diſciples, or <hi>community</hi> of the Church, to look out, from among themſelves, or to chuſe the perſons, that were to be ſet apart thereto, unto their Office, which they did accordingly, &amp;c.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>If we look impartially into this <hi>ſtory</hi> of the <hi>choice</hi> of <hi>Deacons,</hi> here mentioned, we ſhall find no <hi>power</hi> at all of Election in the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of <hi>Diſciples,</hi> but what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to allow them, upon this occaſion; they therefore do here appoint them to <hi>chuſe</hi> to look out men among themſelves, and they to determine certain <hi>bounds</hi> of their <hi>choice,</hi> and <hi>election.</hi> 1. To take <hi>ſeven,</hi> neither more, nor fewer. 2. Thoſe ſeven men <hi>generally known</hi> and <hi>reputed</hi> of. 3.

                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:97334:105"/> and <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> for the managery of the affairs to be committed to them. According to which <hi>permiſſion</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>rules</hi> preſcribed by them, they proceeded, <hi>verſe</hi> 5, <hi>and choſe</hi> Stephen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom they ſet before the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and when they had prayed, <hi>they</hi> (the Apoſtles) <hi>laid their hands on them.</hi> The <hi>right of Election</hi> here, evidently lay in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> themſelves; nor did the <hi>community</hi> of <hi>Diſciples</hi> act any thing otherwiſe, than by <hi>power</hi> delegated from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their preſcriptions; and this <hi>power</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated, was no more than a bare <hi>nomination,</hi> or <hi>teſtimonial approbation,</hi> of <hi>ſeven</hi> ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be ordained <hi>Deacons</hi> for the preſent ſervice, by the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, let the ſtory be ſuppoſed never ſo full to the Catechiſt's purpoſe, <q>[That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did this to give a rule to the future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of all Churches, in the conſtitution of Officers among them,]</q> is, I am ſure, beſide the <hi>text,</hi> and not only <hi>deſtitute of,</hi> but <hi>contrary to,</hi> other Scripture-warrant; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible, amongſt the Ordinations of Church-officers, recorded in Scripture, to find ſuch another <hi>pattern.</hi> And if this be the <hi>rule</hi> of all <hi>future proceedings,</hi> there muſt be alwayes <hi>ſeven</hi> choſen, and no <hi>officers</hi> in any <hi>Church,</hi> but vvhat are taken from among themſelves, as theſe here vvere, and choſen by the <hi>Laity</hi> only.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſenſe,</hi> is uſed of <hi>chuſing</hi> by <hi>ſuffrages,</hi> (as in <hi>popular elections,</hi> &amp;c.) it is certain, that their <hi>own,</hi> not <hi>others ſuffrages,</hi> are meant by it. They then that look ſo far back to the <hi>original</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> as to think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to render it, <hi>Suffragiis creare,</hi> to <hi>ordain</hi> by <hi>ſuffrages,</hi> are certainly guilty of very <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent nicety,</hi> for to ſay, that they <hi>created</hi> them by their <hi>own ſuffrages,</hi> is, to ſay no more, but that they <hi>joyntly</hi> did <hi>ordain</hi> them, (and indeed, being but two, there could be no place for <hi>ſuffrages</hi>); and to affirm, they did it by the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:97334:110"/> 
                  <hi>ſuffrages</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> is not agreeable to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended uſe</hi> of the word.</p>
               <p>Theſe Scripture-proofs, therefore, we have been referr'd unto; afford nothing for any man's <hi>conſcience</hi> to rely upon, as to this <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar election</hi> of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſo zealouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, as an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>rightful liberty</hi> of the <hi>community</hi> of <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and <hi>indiſpenſable qualification</hi> of every <hi>Church-officer;</hi> and, we are already inſtructed by the Catechiſt, not to ſatisfie our ſelves with any <hi>arguments,</hi> be they never ſo plauſible, that are not <hi>derived</hi> from the <hi>H. Scriptures.</hi> What indeed can beſpeak a thing to be <hi>Chriſt's inſtitution,</hi> but his own <hi>word</hi> of <hi>command?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet I will beſtow a few reflections upon his <hi>reaſons,</hi> ſuperadded to theſe <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and then offer him ſome <hi>contrary arguments</hi> to chew upon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he tells us, <q>[That the <hi>Antients</hi> do abundantly teſtifie this <hi>right</hi> and <hi>priviledge</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in <hi>chuſing</hi> their <hi>Governours,</hi> to have been a long time preſerved invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in the <hi>primitive Churches;</hi>]</q> but he names none of thoſe <hi>Antients,</hi> and apparently ſlights the authority of the <hi>Antients</hi> in other matters. And I challenge him to produce any of thoſe <hi>Antients,</hi> who aſſert this, 1. To be the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>priviledge</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and then, 2. <hi>As ſuch,</hi> to have been <hi>preſerved</hi> invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a long time, in the <hi>Primitive Churches,</hi> 'Tis acknowledged indeed, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others do teach, that the <hi>ordaining</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:97334:110"/> ought to be in the preſence of the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to the intent they may <hi>object</hi> any thing againſt them, if they can; and that it was the <hi>ordinary cuſtom [mores &amp; merita ſingulorum communi conſilio ponderare,</hi>] to <hi>adviſe</hi> and <hi>weigh</hi> with <hi>common advice, (viz.</hi> of ſuch as knew them) <hi>every man's manners and deſerts;</hi> but they no where affirm it the <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>people,</hi> to <hi>Elect</hi> thoſe that ſhall be ſet over them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We are pointed to <q>[the <hi>ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi> of this imaginary <hi>inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt, to a <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> which is ſaid to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>voluntary conſent,</hi> and to be a ſtate of <hi>abſolute liberty;</hi> and, to have their <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Overſeers</hi> impoſed on them without their <hi>choice,</hi> is contrary to that <hi>liberty.</hi>]</q> We have ſeen<note n="†" place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> before, this <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> of his, to be as very a dream, as this, vvhich he now calls <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>inſtitution</hi> in it: and it may not be unſeaſonable here, to remarque, That his <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> of <hi>entring</hi> into a <hi>Society</hi> by <hi>conſent,</hi> and the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> no leſs ſtrikes at the <hi>Civil government,</hi> than the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> having before told us,<note place="margin">Cat. p. 117.</note> that <q>[without this conſent, no Society of any kind can exiſt.]</q> In reaſoning thus therefore againſt the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> is certainly concerned. Chriſt requires a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> obedience, for <hi>conſcience ſake,</hi> to the <hi>Civil government,</hi> no leſs than to that of the Church; and <hi>ſubjection,</hi> in <hi>lawful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> to the <hi>lawful powers</hi> of both, is no piece of <hi>ſlavery</hi> and <hi>bondage,</hi> nothing oppoſite to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:97334:111"/> 
                  <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> ſave unto thoſe only, who make all <hi>dutiful obedience</hi> unto their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, <hi>ſuch.</hi> If ſo it be, that our <hi>Catechiſt</hi>'s <hi>reaſon</hi> ſtand good, that, <q>[where the people have not their free <hi>conſent</hi> in the <hi>choice</hi> of their <hi>Paſtors,</hi> they are conſidered as <hi>mute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> or <hi>brute creatures</hi>]</q> This reaſoning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no leſs to the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> than to the <hi>Church,</hi> and there muſt not be in the <hi>one,</hi> any more than in the <hi>other,</hi> any <hi>Rulers,</hi> but ſuch as are of the <hi>peoples choice</hi> and <hi>appointment,</hi> And vve have ſeen enough in theſe late times, to perſwade us, that this is the mind and ſenſe of the <hi>ſeparate brethren,</hi> had they but <hi>power</hi> anſwerable to their <hi>wills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is inſinuated, that, <q>[The <hi>body</hi> of the Church hath ſome duty to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged towards Chriſt, in this <hi>inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Church-government,</hi> which they cannot perform, if the <hi>choice</hi> of <hi>Paſtors</hi> be denied them.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>But what <hi>duty</hi> of the people he means, is not farther expreſſed; nor do I know any <hi>obligation</hi> which the people have, as to the <hi>Officers</hi> ſet over them, beſides their <hi>Prayers</hi> for them; their endeavours by teſtimonies of <hi>known crimes</hi> to lawful Authority, for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>unfit</hi> perſons <hi>ordination,</hi> and their <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> unto thoſe that ſhall be ſet over them; all which may well enough be performed, though the <hi>choice</hi> of their <hi>Paſtors</hi> be denied them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is boldly affirmed, <q>[That there is no other ordinary way of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:97334:111"/> authority unto any, which is either <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> or <hi>Scriptural</hi>]</q>; but as this is affirmed only, without either <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Scripture</hi> to back it, ſo it may ſuffice as peremptorily to <hi>deny</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Which, I the rather do, to ſhorten my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on this <hi>ſubject;</hi> and, becauſe I am now, according to my promiſe, to <hi>demonſtrate,</hi> That it is, upon ſeveral accounts, <hi>unmeet</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,</hi> (whatever is by the Catechiſt and others pretended) that the <hi>election</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſhould be left unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Prieſthood</hi> under the <hi>Law</hi> was not of the <hi>peoples choice,</hi> but of <hi>God</hi>'s, by the hand of <hi>Moſes, Exod,</hi> 28.1. And in their <hi>conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> afterwards, the people are aſſembled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for <hi>ſolemnity-ſake,</hi> and, it may be, a <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> but <hi>act</hi> nothing towards the performance of the whole buſineſs, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.6, 7. And again, after that, upon <hi>Aaron</hi>'s deceaſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> alone, without the <hi>peoples ſuffrage,</hi> ſubſtitutes <hi>Eleazar</hi> into his Office, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.18. True indeed, at the <hi>conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Levites,</hi> the <q>people put their hands on the Levites heads, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.10, 12.</q> but that was done only in <q>token of their being preſented to God's ſervice, inſtead of their firſt-born, as God had choſen them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.45.</q> —There was not then this way of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> as to the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> and what ſaith the <hi>New?</hi> 
                  <q>No man taketh this honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, but he that is called of God, as

               <argument>
                  <p>Impoſition of hands in ordination, limited by the Catechiſt, to the Presbytery of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, wherein the perſon is ordained. The Scripture gives this power to Biſhops. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s judgment of the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery. Two Queſtions reſolved by the Catechiſt, in the negative. <hi>Qu. 1.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a perſon may be lawfully call'd to, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a part of the office, or work of the Miniſtry only? The Catechiſt's grounds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and diſabled. Scripture-preſidents inſtanced in the ſeven Deacons. Chriſt's baptizing by his Diſciples. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to himſelf. The Catechiſt's own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers divided in the parts of their office, and his Ruling-Elders oppoſed to Preaching-Elders. No repugnancy herein with the authority of the Miniſtry, or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Elders and the Church. The exerciſe of gifts reſtrainable, till there be right and authority given, and after that too, by the rules of prudence, good order, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The Church may lawfully admit to a part of the Miniſtry only, and advance her Miniſters by degrees. <hi>Qu. 2.</hi> Whether a perſon may hold the relation, or exerciſe, the duty of a Miniſter, to more Churches than one, at the ſame time? The Catechiſt's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſet down at large, with the reaſons of it, and then refuted under ſix propoſitions, which
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:97334:114"/> are manifeſted to be aſſerted by him. <hi>1.</hi> That none can be a Goſpel-miniſter, unleſs firſt choſen by ſome particular Church. <hi>2.</hi> That none can be ordained a Miniſter, but with relation to ſome particular Church, as his cure and charge. <hi>3.</hi> That no Miniſter hath power to depute another for his Curat, Vicar, or Subſtitute. <hi>4.</hi> That no Miniſter may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his power, or office, out of that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, wherein, and whereto he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. <hi>5.</hi> That no Miniſter may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to more Churches than one, at the ſame time. Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>T.C.</hi> about the Similitudes vulgarly uſed from a Shepherd and his Flock, &amp;c. <hi>6.</hi> The no Miniſter may remove from one Church, or Charge, to another, without re-ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Mr. <hi>Hooker's</hi> judgment, for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confuſion in ſuch like queſtions as theſe, moved by the Catechiſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe fifth thing required by the Catechiſt, to the <hi>due conſtitution</hi> of an <hi>Elder, Paſtor,</hi> or <hi>Teacher</hi> of the Church, is;</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now, the <hi>Exception</hi> I make to this, is, That in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> it ſelf, there is no mention made of the <hi>perſons</hi> that are to <hi>lay on their hands.</hi> In the <hi>ordination</hi> and in the <hi>explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it is limited and reſtrained, 1.

The three places of Scripture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd unto in the Anſwer, may afford us ſome better light in this matter.—<hi>Act.</hi> 13.2, 3. which treats of the ordination of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> referrs the <hi>impoſition</hi> of <hi>hands</hi> to <hi>Simeon, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> and <hi>Manaen, Biſhops</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Syria,</hi> called in the Text <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> (ſome of them, probably, having the ſpecial <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>propheſie</hi>) verſe 1.— 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. referrs the <hi>laying on of hands</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> alone, in the ſingular number, to whom the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> there ſends this command, <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man.</hi>— The third Text, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. ſpeaks of <hi>Timothie</hi>'s own <hi>ordination,</hi> where mention is made of the <hi>laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</hi> Unto which yet, it had been but good manners to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a fourth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 16. ſpeaking plainly of the ſame thing, <hi>Stir up,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, the gift that is in thee, by the putting on of my hands.</hi> I will not here inſiſt on that difference which ſome obſerve in the <hi>original,</hi> that the <hi>prepoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in this latter Text, is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In the reflection upon which, I note,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the thing, which he denies, may be done <hi>occaſionally,</hi> is, by himſelf inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>p.</hi> 139.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſeems here to be preſuppoſed, that the work of the <hi>Goſpel-miniſtry,</hi> is not <hi>diviſible,</hi> but ſuch as muſt neceſſarily <hi>go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,</hi> and appertain to <hi>all</hi> Miniſters alike; <q>the ſeveral names given them in Scripture, appertaining unto all in like manner;</q> as he

               <p>It will not be difficult therefore, to anſwer to his arguments here pointed to in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then, Whereas he ſaith, <q>[It hath not warrant, or preſident in Scripture]</q>; I inſtance to the contrary. 1. In the <hi>ſeven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> who were admitted to a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> only, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and therefore <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Deacon,</hi> though he preached, and baptized the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> yet preſumed not to <hi>lay</hi> his <hi>hands</hi> on them, that they might <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but left that as a ſpecial <hi>prerogative</hi> of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12, 14, 17. 2. Chriſt himſelf (though he wanted neither Gift nor Authority, yet) in the exerciſe of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, baptized not, himſelf, but by his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, St. <hi>John</hi> 4.2. 3. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <q>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but <hi>Criſpus</hi> and <hi>Gaius,</hi> leſt any ſhould ſay, that I had baptized in mine own name; and I baptized alſo the houſhold of <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas:</hi> beſides, I know not whether I baptized any other; for, Chriſt ſent me not to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but to preach the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14, 15, 16, 17.</q> And, 4thly, I object to the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſt, his <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cat. p. 151.</note> divided in the parts of their <hi>office</hi> and <hi>function,</hi> and his <hi>Ruling-Elders</hi> only oppoſed to <hi>Preaching-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Of which, in their place, hereafter.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To this I reply. That he anſwers the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> who obſerves the <hi>rules</hi> of that particular <hi>function</hi> and <hi>office</hi> whereto he is <hi>commiſſioned</hi> and <hi>ordained,</hi> be it more or leſs, of an inferiour or ſuperiour degree, that makes no difference. An inferiour Officer may be as true to his Authority, as a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, though it extend not ſo far, or to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>acts.</hi> Nor is he wanting to the Authority of his Miniſtry, who, that he may attend, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſome higher Concern of his Office, leaves certain lower parts of it, to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by others, who are alſo authorized thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſaith, <q>[It is not conſiſtent with the nature of that relation which is between the Elders and the Church,]</q> but he ſpecifies not his <hi>meaning</hi> in any particular.</p>
               <p>A Church-officer, certainly, is no farther related to the Church, than as to thoſe <hi>acts</hi> whereto his Authority and Commiſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, nor ought the Church to expect more from him than he is authorized unto.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He ſaith, <q>[The exerciſe of Gifts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is not to be reſtrained.]</q> But here he ſhould do well to remember, 1.

                  <q>The Office of them that are to inſtruct the Church in the name and authority of Chriſt, is one and the ſame, as hath been ſhewed before; and, there are many names that are equally accommodated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that are partakers of it, as, <hi>Elders, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Guides.</hi> They are all alike <hi>Elders,</hi> alike <hi>Biſhops,</hi> alike <hi>Guides;</hi> have the one Office in common amongſt them, and every one the whole entire unto himſelf. But there are names alſo given unto them, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed, not as to office, but as to their work and employment, in the diſcharge of that office: ſuch are <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97334:128"/> Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. which are placed, as <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſons</hi> in their work, <hi>partakers</hi> of the ſame <hi>office.</hi> Now, the foundation of this <hi>diſtinction</hi> and <hi>difference</hi> lies, (1.) In the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent gifts</hi> that they have received. (2.) In the nature of the work of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in the Church, which in general may be referr'd unto two <hi>heads,</hi> or <hi>ends;</hi> 1. Inſtruction in the knowledge of God, and Chriſt, and the myſteries of the Goſpel. 2. Exhortation to walk anſwerably unto light received, in <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and univerſal <hi>obedience.— He that teacheth on teaching, he that exhorteth on exhortation,</hi> Rom, 12.7, 8.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>How the <hi>office</hi> ſhould be entirely the ſame, and the <hi>work</hi> ſtatedly, and by the will of Chriſt, <hi>diſtinct,</hi> I muſt confeſs my ſelf ſo dull, as not to comprehend; ſince the <hi>office</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>power</hi> in order to the <hi>whole work.</hi> And I do much admire the <hi>illuminations</hi> of thoſe, who can diſcern no difference at all in all other names gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Miniſters</hi> in H. Scripture, and yet can find ſo palpable an one in <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> to be ſure, ſaw not by their <hi>light,</hi> when he took their <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> both for one, and made this remarque upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. That the Apoſtle ſaith not, as before, <hi>Alios pastores, alios doctores.</hi> Some <hi>paſtors,</hi> and <hi>ſome doctors</hi> or <hi>teachers;</hi> but joyneth them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſaith, <hi>Alios paſtores &amp; doctores.</hi> Some <hi>paſtors and teachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis, methinks, a <hi>pretty device,</hi> thus to refer all the work of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to <hi>preaching,</hi> and then to ſhare it ſo between two, (like <hi>Dod</hi>

(1.) The <hi>different gifts</hi> that <hi>Miniſters</hi> receive, and that too, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>different degrees</hi> of thoſe <hi>gifts,</hi> (as the Catechiſt farther explains himſelf); then ſure, there muſt be almoſt as many <hi>names</hi> of <hi>difference,</hi> as there are <hi>perſons</hi> in the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> for they do generally vary in their <hi>gifts,</hi> or, at leaſt, the <hi>degrees</hi> of their <hi>gifts.</hi> But if, (2.) In the nature of the work of the Miniſtry, we muſt add to <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers, Baptizers, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſts, Orators, Comforters, Adminiſterers</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi> for theſe all refer to different <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel-miniſtry,</hi> which are not here ſpecified; <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore, who is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to, contents not himſelf with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe two, but puts many other acts, by way of inſtance, in company with them. <q>Having then gifts differing,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.6, 7, 8.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the grace that is given unto us, whether propheſying, let us propheſie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion of faith; or Miniſtry, let us wait on our miniſtring; or he that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on teaching, or he that exhorteth on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; he that giveth, let him do it with ſimplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, How appears it, that the Apoſtle here meant any <hi>diſtinct officer</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> any <hi>Ruling-Elder,</hi> and not rather extended his admonition unto all to whom the charge of <hi>Ruling</hi> is committed; even the <hi>Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> as well as any other, of whom doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, <hi>diligence,</hi> is alſo required? for, having, in the beginning of this 8 verſe, joyned to the two immediately precedent, gone through with <hi>Church-offices,</hi> he may be thought, without injury to the Text, to ſtrike out into more general, and common duties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he holds on to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <p>I cannot give the Reader better ſatisfaction about this place, than by abbreviating what our Learned Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath already offered concerning it, in a moſt excellent diſcourſe upon this Text.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:97334:137"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> on 1 Tim. 5.17.</note>There are two things, ſaith he, in theſe words, to be explicated. 1. What is meant here by <hi>Elders.</hi> And, 2. What by this <hi>double honour</hi> due unto them.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: there is no queſtion but the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel of Chriſt, were contained under this name, for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> is uſed for the <hi>Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments,</hi> in the Goſpel; whence cometh the <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>Prieſter,</hi> and our now Engliſh word <hi>Prieſt.</hi> And the Antient Fathers thought theſe only to be here meant, and never dreamed of any others. None of the Fathers, which have commented upon this place, neither <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Hierom, Ambroſe, Theodoret, Primaſius, Oecumenius,</hi> or <hi>Theophylact,</hi> (as they had no ſuch, ſo) ever thought of any ſuch <hi>Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to be here meant; but, as was ſaid, <hi>Prieſts</hi> only, which adminiſtred the Word and Sacraments.</p>
               <p>But, How, will you ſay then, is this place to be underſtod, which may ſeem, as 'tis alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to intimate two ſorts of Elders; ſome that <hi>ruled</hi> onely, others that <hi>laboured</hi> alſo in the the Word and Doctrine?</p>
               <p>The Divines of our Church have given di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Expoſitions of theſe words, none of which give place to any ſuch new-found El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. I will relate four of the chief, to which the reſt are reducible.</p>
               <p>The firſt is grounded upon the uſe of the <hi>participle</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, which is often wont to note the reaſon, or condition of a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:97334:137"/> thing, and accordingly to be reſolved by a <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi> or <hi>conditional conjunction.</hi> 
                  <q>[Let the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or Presbyters, that rule or govern their Flocks well, be accounted worthy of double honour, and that chiefly, in reſpect, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, of their labour in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.]</q> And ſo this manner of ſpeech will imply two <hi>duties,</hi> but not two <hi>ſorts,</hi> or <hi>orders</hi> of <hi>Elders;</hi> and that, though this <hi>double honour</hi> be due unto them for both, yet principally, for the ſecond, their <hi>labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> And this way goes St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and other <hi>Greek Writers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond Expoſition is taken from the force and ſignification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies, not ſimply, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to <hi>labour,</hi> but to <hi>labour with much travail and toil,</hi> (for, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Vexor, laboribus &amp; moleſtiis premor,</hi> and ſo properly ſignifies <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiam,</hi> or <hi>fatigationem ex labore.</hi>) Thus the meaning will be, <q>[Let the Elders that do <hi>(benè praeſidere)</hi> govern and inſtruct their flock well, be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially ſuch of them as take more than ordinary pains in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.]</q> Or thus; <q>[Let the Elders that diſcharge their Office well, be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by how much the more their painfulneſs and travel ſhall exceed in preaching the Word and Doctrine.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have we ſeen two Expoſitions, neither of them implying two ſorts or Orders of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but only diſtinguiſhing ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or Duties, of the ſame Order; or imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97334:138"/> a different <hi>merit</hi> in the diſcharge of them. But, if they will by no means be perſwaded, but that two ſorts of <hi>Elders</hi> are here intimated, Let it be ſo; two other <hi>Expoſitions</hi> will yield them it, but ſo as will not be for their turn, for their <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> will be none of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, That the Apoſtle ſhould ſpeak here of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both as members of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory,</hi> or <hi>Senate,</hi> which conſiſted of <hi>both or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and in that reſpect might well include them both under the name of <hi>Elders,</hi> it being a common notion in Scripture, to call the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates</hi> of a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature</hi> by that name. <hi>Senatus</hi> hath it's name <hi>à Senibus,</hi> i. <hi>Senioribus,</hi> of <hi>Elderſhip;</hi> and, is as much to ſay, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And, according to this ſuppoſal, the Apoſtle's words may have this conſtruction; <q>[Let the <hi>Elders</hi> which rule well, whether <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Deacons,</hi> be counted worthy of <hi>double honour;</hi> but more eſpecially the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who, beſides their Government, <hi>labour</hi> alſo in the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine.</hi>]</q> And, 'tis not improbable, but the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhould make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, as well for the maintenance of <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> as of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> ſeeing he omits it not of Widows, in the verſe going next before this; but, unleſs he includes them under the name of <hi>Elders,</hi> he makes no <hi>proviſion</hi> for them at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another Expoſition, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows alſo of two ſorts of <hi>Elders</hi> to be here implyed, but makes them both <hi>Prieſts;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Priests,</hi> in the Apoſtles

                  </gap>, ſpoken of here by the Apoſtle; That both theſe ſorts of <hi>Presbyters</hi> were to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy of <hi>double honour,</hi> as well <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as thoſe that <hi>travelled up and down to preach the Goſpel;</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; but eſpecially theſe <hi>latter,</hi> becauſe their pains were more than the others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from the uſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in Scripture ſignifies, not only <hi>corporal labour,</hi> as may appear in many places; but ſeems to be uſed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> even in this very ſenſe now given, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. where he ſayes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelf with the other <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>

                  </gap>. <hi>I have travelled up and down more than they all;</hi> as is manifeſt he did.</p>
               <p>But, give me leave, ſaith Mr. <hi>Mede;</hi> to propound a <hi>fifth Expoſition,</hi> which ſhall yield all they contend for ſo eagerly, to be implyed in this Text; namely, That there are not only two ſorts of <hi>Elders</hi> here implied, but alſo that the one of them are <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> ſuch as have nothing to do with the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi> What would they
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:97334:139"/> have more? yet they will be never the nearer for this <hi>conceſſion;</hi> for, the <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> here implyed, may be no <hi>Church-officers,</hi> but <hi>Civil Magiſtrates,</hi> which, in Scripture-language, we know are called <hi>Elders;</hi> as, when we read of the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>the Prieſts,</hi> and the <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> and the like; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which notion, the words may be conſtrued thus; <q>[Let all Elders that govern well, of what ſort ſoever, be counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double honour; eſpecially, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, which <hi>labour</hi> in Word and Doctrine.]</q> Is not this good ſenſe? and doth not the Apoſtle, in the beginning of this very Chapter, uſe the name <hi>Elder,</hi> in the larger, and more general ſenſe, when he ſayes, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke not an Elder, but exhort him as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. Why may he not then do ſo here? And doth not St. <hi>James,</hi> in his laſt Chapter, call the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi>

               <p>Thus, having informed our ſelves, <hi>who</hi> they are, which are here termed <hi>Elders,</hi> we will now ſee alſo briefly, what is that <hi>honour</hi> which is due into them.

The firſt of them, he alledges alſo, in the ſame argument, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <q>where he adds, Doth God take care for Oxen? or, ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? (ours, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that preach the Goſpel) for our ſakes, no doubt, this is written, that he which ploweth, ſhould plow in hope, and he that threſheth in hope ſhould be partaker of his hope.</q> The caſe is plain. 'Tis an <hi>Hebrew</hi> notion. To <hi>bring honour.</hi> i. e. to <hi>pay tribute,</hi> or <hi>bring</hi> a <hi>preſent, Revel.</hi> 21.26. —But, what is meant by <hi>double honour?</hi> Some, (as among the <hi>Fathers,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) will have it to be <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Maintenance,</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> But, becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>proofs</hi> here inferr only <hi>maintenance,</hi> I take it to be meant in this place only of it.

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, That <hi>publick prayer</hi> is to provide for <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>common wants; private</hi> and <hi>ſecret prayer,</hi> for <hi>private</hi> and <hi>perſonal wants;</hi> and yet, both <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>private wants</hi> may be comprized in a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer;</hi> the <hi>publick</hi> in a <hi>Form</hi> preſcribed, the <hi>private</hi> in a <hi>Form</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated. But, for the private and perſonal wants of every particular, to be regarded in Publick Prayer, is a thing that never was, and never will be practicable; farther than as <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars</hi> are provided for, under certain <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heads,</hi> whereto they may be referr'd. For the Texts of Scripture cited, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <q>The Spirit's helping our infirmities,</q> I deſign to ſpeak to in the next Chapter. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. <q>is only an injunction of the duty of Prayer, upon every occaſion.</q> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <q>is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to come boldly on all occaſions to the Throne of Grace.</q> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires from us watching unto Prayer.</q> Which may certainly be done, by <hi>premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and a carefulneſs over our own Spirits, that we be not diſcompoſed for that <hi>ſervice.</hi> There is nothing in all theſe Texts, againſt the uſing of <hi>Set Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer.</hi>

                  <q>[2. 'Tis contrary to the <hi>main end</hi> that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt aimed at, in ſupplying men with gifts, for the diſcharging the work of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> tending to render the <hi>promiſe</hi> of <hi>ſending the H.

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, That, among all the <hi>Gifts</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in H.

               </p>
               <p>—Here alſo, it might be farther noted, That the <hi>Gift of Prayer,</hi> being no <hi>peculiar</hi> of the <hi>Miniſter's,</hi> but <hi>common</hi> alſo to the <hi>People,</hi> (who have no leſs an intereſt in the promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. than he) upon the ſcore of this <hi>allegation</hi> now made, every one may pretend to a liberty of <hi>praying,</hi> and ſo <hi>venting</hi> the private manifeſtations of the <hi>Spirit</hi> (as he thinks) to himſelf, at the ſame time as the <hi>Miniſter</hi> prayes, unleſs the Catechiſt remember to interpoſe his <hi>Prudentials,</hi> for the preventing of this <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</hi>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:97334:159"/> 
                  <hi>immediate</hi> fore-thought, or diſtinct reflection upon thoſe <hi>Rules.</hi> The like I might ſay of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> or any other <hi>myſtery.</hi> For, in all theſe <hi>caſes, Rules,</hi> known and underſtood, turn into an <hi>habitual diſpoſition</hi> within; the man acts from an <hi>habitual knowledg</hi> and <hi>preparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, on the ſame account, he that hath <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured</hi> his <hi>thoughts</hi> to the <hi>meditation</hi> and <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> of the heads of <hi>practical Divinity,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Attributes of God,</hi> the <hi>Laws and Rules of a good life,</hi> the <hi>Sins contrary to thoſe Laws and Rules,</hi> the <hi>Mercies received from God,</hi> the <hi>ordinary Temptations we are ſurrounded with,</hi> &amp;c. may be habitually provided for <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> upon occaſion; <hi>i. e.</hi> for the <hi>turning of theſe heads into Prayer,</hi> without the flying to any <hi>peculiar,</hi> or <hi>ſpecial gift of the Spirit,</hi> in the caſe.

               <p n="2">2. A <hi>quick invention</hi> and <hi>ready elocution,</hi> an <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive fancie</hi> and a <hi>nimble tongue.</hi> The <hi>Gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> indeed, is the <hi>immediate reſult</hi> of theſe. A man thus accompliſh'd, premiſing but an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie underſtanding</hi> of the <hi>Rules of Prayer,</hi> may be able to ſpeak his mind in <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>pertinent words,</hi> with as much <hi>eaſe,</hi> by the <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>un-obſerved multiplying</hi> of <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>active thoughts,</hi> as one of <hi>ſlower parts,</hi> by much <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation.</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:97334:160"/> But then there is no more of a <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>peculiar gift</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in this, than in ſome mens being qualified to ſpeak their minds upon ſeveral points on the ſudden, whilſt others are more ſlow of <hi>conceit,</hi> and worſe-provided for <hi>utterance.</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, 'Tis to be feared, it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>reſult of Malice, Envie, and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> againſt the <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer preſcribed,</hi> to procure <hi>Envie</hi> againſt the complyers with

               <p>And, if it owe its riſe to theſe three latter heads, of Impudence and Preſumption, of Pride and Ambition, of Malice and Envy, 'tis a thing abominable before God and man, that the Holy performance of Prayer ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as an engine of ſo much baſeneſs and wickedneſs. Otherwiſe, the thing it ſelf is not culpable, provided, that the exerciſe and ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of invention, take not up the room of (and ſo juſtle out) true devotion.</p>

                  <q>Thus much of the <hi>Gift of Prayer</hi> in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; but then the Queſtion remains, of the agency and influence of the H.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively.</hi> 
                  <q>'Tis not to be expected from the H.

Spirit,</hi> an immediate <hi>inſpiration</hi> of the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words of Prayer:</hi> and I will confirm it, by a three-fold Argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Were it otherwiſe, neither <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> nor our <hi>B. Sauiour</hi> need have taught their Diſciples any <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> as they did. This pains were ſuperfluous, if it were the office and work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> immediately to <hi>inſpire</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words</hi> of <hi>prayer.</hi> To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were this waſte? And, I think, he may as reaſonably deny the <hi>Sun</hi> to ſhine at <hi>noon-day,</hi> who will affirm, the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> to be no <hi>Set Form;</hi> whereas the words are evidently moulded into a Prayer, and enjoyned by our Saviour,<note place="margin">St. Luke 11.1, 2.</note> in their uſe, for ſuch;—<hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our Father</hi> — And this <hi>injunction</hi> given too, in anſwer to their requeſt, <hi>Lord, teach us to pray, as</hi> John <hi>alſo taught his Diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Were it the Office of the Spirit, to put words and matter immediately into mens thoughts and tongues, Chriſt ſhould have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, inſtead of this anſwer, <q>[When ye pray,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:97334:162"/> ſay, Our Father.</q>—] that which he elſewhere gave for their encouragement, when arraigned before Heathen-Governours, <q>[Take no thought how, or what ye ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour; the Spirit of my Father ſhall ſpeak in you.]</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Were this conceit true, of the Spirit's <hi>immediate dictating</hi> of the matter and words of Prayer, then <q>every Prayer ſhould be of as good and authentick authority, as the H. Scripture it ſelf.</q> For, whence is the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Holy Scripture; and, why do we afford it ſo abſolute a <hi>reverence,</hi> but becauſe it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>given by inſpiration from God?</hi> The Prophets and Pen-men of it, ſpake and wrote, as they were <hi>moved and acted by the H. Ghoſt.</hi> Now, if the <hi>Spirit</hi> did immediately <hi>help</hi> every perſon that <hi>prayeth,</hi> to the matter and words of <hi>Prayer;</hi> we muſt needs affirm, <q>Every Prayer to be in like manner, by inſpiration from God, and every man that prayes, to be moved and acted by the Spirit, and to ſpeak as he is moved by the H. Ghoſt.</q> Were this ſo, it might prove, I confeſs, of conſiderable advantage unto ſome, and help them to <hi>new</hi> Scriptures for their wayes and actions, directly contrary to the <hi>old,</hi> which we know to have been <hi>truly inſpired of God.</hi> But, far be it from us, to <hi>canonize</hi> all the <hi>extravagancies</hi> (to ſay nothing worſe) of ſome mens <hi>prayers,</hi> pretending moſt <hi>highly</hi> to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as of <hi>equal authority with the holy, pure, and infallible Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:97334:163"/>3. Were it the Office of the <hi>H. Spirit,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>ſuggeſt</hi> unto every one that prayes, the matter and words of Prayer, it were then impoſſible for <q>any number to joyn together in offering up the ſame prayers and petitions unto God:</q> For, let the <hi>Speaker,</hi> or <hi>Miniſter,</hi> pray never ſo much <hi>Ex-tempore,</hi> as 'tis call'd, and without <hi>premeditation,</hi> and by the <hi>Spirit's inſpiration,</hi> as is pretended; yet his very Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will be the hearer's direction and help, both to the matter and words of Prayer, and as much a confinement for the time, as any other Form made, and preſcribed to their hands. The moſt <hi>Extempore-Prayer,</hi> is (as I have before alſo intimated) <q>an abſolute ſet Form to all but the utterer of it;</q> and therefore, 'tis the meereſt <hi>non-ſenſe</hi> in the world, to exclaim againſt Praying in Publick by a Form, when there can be no Publick Prayer managed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. It is not then to be expected from the H. Spirit, that he ſhould immediately fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with the matter and words of Prayer. That for <hi>negative:</hi> And from thence,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>affirmative</hi> follows. If not <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi> then, of neceſſity, <hi>mediatè,</hi> by the uſe of proper and fitting means conducing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: For there is no third way to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of. The <hi>Spirit's</hi> help, as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words of Prayer, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Gift of Prayer) muſt be either <hi>immediate,</hi> without the uſe of means; or <hi>mediate,</hi> by the uſe of means conducible thereunto. I will not deny, but the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> might <q>ſometimes pray by the extraordinary and immediate inſpirations of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:97334:163"/> the Spirit, as they received immediately other <hi>extraordinary gifts.</hi>
                  </q> But, I have already diſcountenanced our expectation of any ſuch <hi>gift</hi> immediately from the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may as juſtly pretend to an immediate <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> whereas it is our <hi>lot,</hi> by the uſe of <hi>fitting</hi> and <hi>ordinary means,</hi> to attain to a part of that <hi>perfection,</hi> which God ſometimes beſtowed, without the uſe of theſe means, extraordinarily. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were fed with <hi>Manna</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> in the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> but when they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the ſweat of their own brows, the fruits and encreaſe of their own labour.—</p>
               <p>Now, theſe <hi>proper means,</hi> by the diligent uſe of which, the Spirit furniſheth us with the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> are, <hi>conſideration</hi> of our <hi>wants, premeditation</hi> of the things we are to ask of God, the <hi>improvement</hi> of our <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculties</hi> of <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>utterance, good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> &amp;c. And, among the reſt, <q>thoſe uſeful Forms which are recommended to us from pious and good men, or preſcribed by Authority, the Common-Prayers of the Church.</q> Thus, if we are qualified for <hi>Prayer</hi> by the help of our <hi>natural parts,</hi> our <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>memory</hi> of <hi>divine truths,</hi> our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> and <hi>elocution;</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> may be ſaid by theſe, to help us to the <hi>materials</hi> and <hi>words of Prayer,</hi> viz. <hi>remotely,</hi> inaſmuch as <q>every good gift is from him, and through his bleſſing.</q>— And thus, ſometimes, whilſt we are giving our ſelves to <hi>meditation,</hi> in order unto <hi>Prayer,</hi> the Spirit may ſet our <q>ſins before our eyes, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:97334:164"/> bring to our remembrance fitting truths to be thought upon.</q>— And thus alſo by the help of "Forms compoſed to our hands. The <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> no queſtion, help'd the <hi>Baptiſt's Diſciples</hi> to the <hi>matter and words of Prayer,</hi> by that <hi>Form</hi> which <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> taught them; and the <hi>Spirit</hi> help'd <hi>Chriſt's Diſciples,</hi> to the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> by that <hi>abſolute,</hi> and <hi>perfect Form of Prayer,</hi> which our B. Saviour taught them, and we alſo have received. And thus the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in like manner, may be ſaid to help us, to the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> by thoſe excellent <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly enjoyned by the <hi>Church</hi> wherein we live. For, What an exceſſive vanity and dotage is it, for particular perſons to conceit themſelves ſo highly in favour with the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Spirit,</hi> as to be aſſiſted, in order to the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> themſelves; and yet deny this <hi>priviledge</hi> to a company of men, as <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> as themſelves, (to ſpeak the leaſt); and more <hi>modeſt</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> than they, (and ſo the more likely to be taught by Him) gather'd together in the <hi>name</hi> of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>But, hitherto, of the <hi>Gift of Prayer,</hi> which concerns the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is <hi>Grace</hi> which is <hi>moſt confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> in <hi>Prayer;</hi> for there may be <q>this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words of Prayer, and yet no praying all the while.</q> 'Tis the Heart and Soul of man that prayes in God's account, and Prayer by him is weighed by the exerciſe of proper graces, and not of natural gifts or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

                  <p>Singing of Pſalms, the Catechiſt's third Goſpel-Inſtitution, ſtily paſſed over. Six points propounded about it, to be reſolved from Scripture. Of Preaching the Word, the fourth Goſpel-Inſtitution. Needful diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about it. Difference between Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Teaching, Evangeliſts and Doctors, Word and Doctrine; between Preaching by Inſpiration, and by Pains and Induſtry.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:97334:168"/> Preaching, more wayes than that of Sermons, by the Vulgar fixed on; <hi>viz.</hi> By Reading, by Writing, by Proxie. The fifth Goſpel-Inſtitution, Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments no Scripture-word. The proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Baptiſm, proper Church-members. The Anabaptiſt mis-lead, by the Catechiſt's principles. Baptiſm ill confined to the infant-ſeed of Believers only. The carriage of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> as to that point. Sitting, not a geſture preſcribed for the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. 'Tis not certain to conſcience, that Chriſt and his Diſciples uſed the ſame geſture at the Supper, as at the Paſs-over. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Paſs-over, different from our ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. No evidence of the will of Chriſt, that we conform to the geſture then uſed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to other circumſtances. The laſt Goſpel-Inſtitution, Church-diſcipline. The power given to the community of the people, Women excepted, in the adminiſtration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by the Catechiſt. His Scripture-inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces conſidered. A three-fold Directory gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by him, for the exerciſe of diſcipline. The politick contrivance of the ſeparate Churches, for perpetuating themſelves.

               </p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> it had been pertinent for him to have declared the <hi>matter,</hi> and the <hi>form</hi> of it, and the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>adminiſtration,</hi> whether by <hi>immerſion</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling;</hi> out of the ſacred <hi>Bible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he makes <hi>profeſſed believers,</hi> the <hi>proper ſubjects</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is certainly conſonant to the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> but how he can avoid making the ſaid <hi>Profeſſors Church-members,</hi> ſince <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> is the door of <hi>admiſſion</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> I apprehend not; and ſo, I leave him to be reconciled to himſelf, in what he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taught, Cat. p. 105, 106. Whereof ſee what hath been remarqued, chap. 2.</p>
               <p>Next, that he diſallows <hi>re-baptization,</hi> and approves of <hi>paedo-baptiſm,</hi> I miſlike not; but he may do well to conſider, that the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> generally argue from his <hi>beloved prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and nothing is more ordinary in their mouths than this, <q>Where have you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs warrant, or Command, in the word of God, for baptizing infants?</q> And, poſſibly, upon tryal, he will find it difficult ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the <hi>points</hi> againſt them, by <hi>naked Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as to pronounce them <hi>hereticks,</hi> for not being of his belief.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſhould be confined to the <hi>infant-ſeed</hi> only of <hi>profeſſed believers,</hi> I find no Scripture-proof, but rather, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears from the parallel between <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:97334:172"/> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> whereto he ſends us, when he quotes <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.12, 13. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11, 12.

               <p>Having ſpoken of the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>ordinances</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>appointed</hi> and <hi>commanded</hi> by him, and therefore duly to be <hi>attended</hi> to, and <hi>obſerved</hi> as part of the <hi>worſhip of God;</hi>

               <p>His meaning is, queſtionleſs, to hint and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that <hi>ſitting</hi> at the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> is a <hi>Geſture determined</hi> by Chriſt, and therefore to be obſerved by the Church, without any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of altering from it, or ſubſtituting any other in the room of it.</p>

The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives this power to Biſhops. <hi>Calvin's</hi> judgment of the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.

Whether a perſon may be lawfully call'd to, of employed in a part of the office, or work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry only? The Catechiſt's grounds examined, and diſabled. Scripture-preſidents inſtanced in the ſeven Deacons. Chriſt's baptizing by his Diſciples. St. <hi>Paul's</hi> allegation as to himſelf. The Catechiſt's own Paſtors and Teachers divided in the parts of their office, and his Ruling Elders oppoſed to Preaching-Elders. No repugnancy herein with the authority of the Miniſtry or relation between the Elders and the Church. The exerciſe of gifts reſtrainable, till there be right and authority given; and after that too, by the rules of prudence, good order, and edification. The Church may lawfully admit to a part of the miniſtry only, and advance her Miniſters by degrees. <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Whether a perſon may hold the relation, or exerciſe the duty of a Miniſter, to more Churches than one, at the ſame time? The Catechiſt's opinion ſet down at large, with the reaſons of it, and then refuted under ſix propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are manifeſted to be aſſerted by him. 1. That none can be a Goſpel-miniſter, unleſs firſt choſen by ſome particular Church. 2. That none can be ordained a Miniſter, but with relation to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, at his cure and charge. 3. That no

That Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men among us have a principal rule in the Church, and, upon that account, our objections againſt Lay-Elders unreaſonable, diſproved.

The change of the Levites, when the Temple was built, from their firſt office, in attending on the Tabernacle, a competent plea for our caſe. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. conſidered.

A ſort of She-officers, Female-Elders, Deaconeſſes, and Widows, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick, and Primitive Church, forgotten by the Catechiſt, in deſcribing the pattern given in the Mount.

<pb facs="tcp:97334:185"/> The Catechiſt's Arguments againſt the uſe of ſuch Forms, anſwered. Publick Prayer, is to provide for common, not perſonal wants. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all gifts in Holy Scripture, no gift of <hi>Ex-tempore</hi>-Prayer mentioned. No injury to any Gift, to be confined to a ſubſerviency unto good Order. The promiſe of the Spirit not rendred hereby needleſs, or uſeleſs. <hi>Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> at no odds with <hi>Our Father.</hi> The gift of Prayer no more promiſed the Miniſter, than People.

The gift of prayer, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly underſtood, nothing elſe but a gift of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, owing its riſe to former Premeditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Quick Parts, a competent degree of modeſt Confidence, and frequent Exerciſe. What the Vulgar call a Special Gift of Prayer, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, ſometimes, of Impudence and Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Pride and Ambition, or ſome worſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. 'Tis not to be expected, that the H. Spirit help us immediately to the matter and words of Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. conſidered. Three Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to demonſtrate the Propoſition. The Spirit helps us to the matter, and words of Prayer, by the uſe of proper, and fit means; among which, may be reckoned, pious and uſeful Forms, compoſed to our hands, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Grace moſt conſiderable in Prayer, and the principal work of the H. Spirit is, to excite, aſſiſt, and ſtrengthen the exerciſe of proper Graces. Where the Form is preſcribed, one grace more to be exerciſed. The chief opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit of Supplications he inwards, in fixing the intention, illuminating the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,

Six points propounded about it, to be reſolved from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Of Preaching the Word, the fourth Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Inſtitution. Needful diſtinctions about it. Difference between Preaching and Teaching, Evangeliſts and Doctors, Word and Doctrine; between Preaching by Inſpiration, and by Pains and Induſtry. Preaching, more ways than that of Sermons, by the Vulgar fixed on; <hi>viz.</hi> By Reading, by Writing, by Proxy. The fifth Goſpel-Inſtitution, Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, Baptiſm and the Lords Supper. Sacraments no Scripture-word. The proper ſubjects of Baptiſm, proper Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The Anabaptiſt miſledd, by the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſts principles. Baptiſm ill confined to the Infant-ſeed of Believers onely. The carriage of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> as to that point. Sitting, not a geſture preſcribed for the Lords Supper. 'Tis not certain to conſcience, that Chriſt and his Diſciples uſed the ſame geſture at the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as at the Paſsover. The geſture of the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, different from our ſitting. No evidence of the Will of Chriſt, that we conform to the geſture then uſed, rather than to other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The laſt Goſpel-Inſtitution, Church-Diſcipline.

            </argument>
            <p>SInce the committing of the foregoing Pages to the Preſs, I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with my ſelf, that among all the Brethren of the Separation, whom I have either known or heard of, there hath

            <p>Now ſo long as theſe Doctrines are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and acknowledged, it is but labour loſt to preſs them unto obedience and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Laws of the Realm about Religion, and the Service of God; ſince theſe Laws themſelves are adjudged by them no other then extravagancies beyond the compaſs of their Rulers Commiſſion, invaſions of Chriſt's Authority, the Churches Priviledge, and every Chriſtians Liberty, unjuſtifiable in themſelves, and therefore of no power to oblige them unto duty, or brand their moſt contemptuous neglects for ſinful tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I have therefore thought it requiſite in order to the fuller confutation of their way and principles, to annex this Appendix, for the rectifying of their apprehenſions, who ſhall be willing impartially to deliberate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what is here offered to them, briefly of theſe two heads.</p>

            <p>Secondly, The obedience due from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. For theſe two are relatives, not to be ſeparated each from other.</p>
            <p>Firſt then concerning the former. I take it for granted that <hi>Government and Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is an Ordinance of God,</hi> and they who liſt to diſpute it, may if they pleaſe, confront and oppoſe St. <hi>Paul's thirteenth Chapter to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> That which I deſign to recommend ſhall be compriſed and demonſtrated in the following particulars.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſupreme or chief power where-ever it is ſeated muſt needs be ſo far independent, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and uncontroulable; Independent</hi> upon any but <hi>God</hi> himſelf, for otherwiſe there will be ſome above it, and ſo it will not be ſupreme and uppermoſt. <hi>Abſolute</hi> it muſt needs be to obtain the ends of Government, where by abſolute I mean, not freed from an obligation to obſerve the <hi>Laws of God</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>to Govern according to humane Laws, ſo far as equity will bear:</hi> but <hi>freed from the fetters of all humane Laws, when the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97334:188"/> of Government</hi> (whereof the Supreme is alſo to judge) <hi>calls for it.</hi> And without this no Government can well be upheld and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, there being ever ſome caſes happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which humane Laws cannot in particular foreſee and provide againſt; and therefore the breaſt of the Supreme muſt make a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. And then being independent on any upon earth, and abſolute in the ſenſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, it muſt needs follow that it is <hi>unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable unto any, uncontroulable by any but God,</hi> Subject to the <hi>coercive reſtraint</hi> of none beſides: for if ſo, that to which it is ſubject will be above it, and ſo it is no longer Supreme and Uppermoſt; and we ſhall lay the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of confuſion in the prime foundation of order.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſupreme and chief Power can be but one,</hi> whether ſeated in a ſingle Perſon, or in more, the ſupreme Power ſtill is but one, not in reference to the ſubject of it, but in reſpect of the power it ſelf, and the actions of command and judgement thence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

If the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be <hi>more</hi> then one, 'tis either in the <hi>Chief,</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> and then 'tis call'd an <hi>Ariſtocracy, i. e.</hi> the Government of the beſt men, the more excellent and noble; or elſe in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and then 'tis called a <hi>Democracy,</hi> i. e. the Government of the People, a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97334:188"/> Now whereever it be placed, there muſt be granted to be but one Supreme and Chief, where for order ſake all Subjects muſt needs reſt, and to whoſe deciſion they muſt neceſſarily ſubmit, as final and terminative in the caſe. Were there more then one Supreme, their <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> might be <hi>contrary,</hi> and ſo the <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>execution impoſſible.</hi> One may call to the <hi>Church,</hi> another at the <hi>ſame time</hi> to the <hi>Camp,</hi> and a third at the ſame time to the <hi>Court;</hi> and one will puniſh for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying him, the ſecond for diſobeying him, and the third alſo for diſobeying him. And from hence muſt needs follow as a <hi>diſcord and diviſion in the Supreme:</hi> So alſo among the <hi>Subjects,</hi> one Faction for this, another for that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>Impoſſibilities, Contradictions, and Principles of diviſion in Government, muſt neceſſarily be avoided.</hi> And here thoſe <hi>Axiomes</hi> of our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> take place, <q>

            <p>
               <hi>The prime Due unto Authority is active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to its commands,</hi> doing what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and forbearing what is prohibited; for therefore are things commanded that they may be performed, and therefore forbidden that they may be forborne: and <hi>therefore is puniſhment threatned to urge perſons either to do or forbear as the Laws require.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97334:200"/> compaſs of its Dominion. To exemplifie this ſomewhat more particularly, I conſider, that <hi>Authority</hi> doth either</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Command what God commands, and forbid what God forbids.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Command and forbid what God neither commands nor forbids.</hi> Or,</p>

            <p>If the Supreme Authority commands what God hath before commanded, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids what God hath forbidden, we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond queſtion obliged actively to obey, <hi>We cannot diſobey it without diſobeying God;</hi> yea there is <hi>an obligation added to that wherewith God had before obliged us.</hi> There is a double Cord as it were binding us faſt unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; <hi>Firſt the Authority of God,</hi> and <hi>under him the Authority of the King.</hi> Such matters as theſe are the Scripture ſtyles <hi>[Praecepta Regis ex verbo Dei] the Commandments of the King by the word of the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 29.15.30.12.</note> And <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> hath thus reſolved the caſe,<note place="margin">Et apud homines poenas luit, &amp; apud Deum ſortem non habebi:, qui hoc facere n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. If Authority command where God hath neither commanded nor forbidden, we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97334:201"/> are likewiſe bound to an active obedience; for what is <hi>neither commanded nor forbidden by God,</hi> is to us left <hi>indifferent, not neceſſary in it ſelf to be done,</hi> becauſe not commanded by God, and yet <hi>lawful to be done, not ſinful if done,</hi> becauſe not forbidden by God, and therefore <hi>we may do it if we will;</hi> and <hi>what we may do if we will in the uſe of our private judgement and prudence, we not only may but muſt,</hi> i. e. <hi>ought to do if Authority require it.</hi> An eminent inſtance of this obedience we have in the <q>Rechabites obeying the command of their Father Jonadab,<note place="margin">See Jer. 35. ch.</note> in not drinking wine throughout their generations,</q> whoſe practice <hi>is</hi> commended <hi>and</hi> rewarded by God <hi>himſelf,</hi> and <hi>urged upon the Jews as an inſtance of obedience worthy to upbraid them with and by.</hi> Things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of <hi>this kinde (i. e.</hi> neither commanded nor forbidden by God) are the moſt <hi>proper ſubject for humane Authority</hi> to diſplay it ſelf about, by inducing <hi>an obligation where none was before.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3.

            </p>
            <p>He that actively obeys Authority in thoſe matters, of the lawfulneſs of which he yet doubts, cannot be ſaid <hi>to act againſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> for <hi>in doubtful matters to do is no more againſt his Conſcience then not to do. What is to a man doubtful is no more againſt his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence then with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor doth he yet <hi>prefer man's command be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God's,</hi> but only <hi>chuſeth to obey a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and manifeſt command of God before an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and dubious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True indeed, <hi>While the man hangs in an equal doubt, he ought not to determine himſelf on either hand,</hi> there is no reaſon on the one ſide more then on the other; but <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Superiour is a ſufficient reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or over-rule the doubt, which was before in the matter:</hi> ſo that after it the man ought no longer to doubt.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97334:202"/>
            <p>Here therefore it will not boot any to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> 
               <q>He that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith; for whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin.</q> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>one that is not ſatisfied about the abrogation of thoſe Laws of God which made a difference between meats clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, or which forbad the eating of things of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Idols under the guilt of Idolatry. This is St.</hi> Paul's <hi>doubter,</hi> and <hi>of ſuch an one he ſaith, If he eat when he doubts that God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him, he is damned; becauſe he eats not of Faith:</hi> i. e. <hi>he ventures upon an act which he knows not but he ſhall ſin grievouſly in the doing of:</hi> for whatſoever a man doth without <hi>this Faith, i. e.</hi> without <hi>this perſwaſion of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it</hi> (as hath been ſhewed in the firſt part of the fore-going diſcourſe) it is <hi>ſin unto him.</hi> The <hi>caſe</hi> he ſpeaks of was <hi>very weighty.</hi> On the <hi>one hand</hi> there was the <hi>ſuppoſal</hi> of the <hi>Law of God forbidding to eat,</hi> and on the <hi>other</hi> hand <hi>nothing to weigh againſt it;</hi> for <hi>no Authority had here interpoſed in the caſe.</hi> And therefore <hi>for him to venture on the breach of a certain command of God, as he fears, without any other warrant then the gratiſying of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, or complying with others cannot be other then a ſin.</hi> For <hi>to venture upon what we know not to be lawful is to declare a willingneſs to admit of what is unlawful,</hi> to adventure on a ſin. When therefore it is determined, that if there be only a doubt of the matter, the command or law of Authority ſhould be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97334:203"/> actively obeyed, the meaning is, that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is a ſufficient reaſon to move us firſt to lay down the doubt, to doubt no longer, and then to betake our ſelves to obedience;</hi> and <hi>thus we keep to our</hi> rule; we are <hi>perſwaded of the lawfulneſs of what we do in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that will ſtate the caſe aright, when the Powers require what he doubteth of, <q>Muſt weigh the plain command of God to obey his Superiour in all lawful matters, <hi>the</hi> vertue and goodneſs of obedience, <hi>and the</hi> evil and ſcandal of diſobedience impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in the ſcale againſt the ſingle doubt he retains on the other hand: <hi>and</hi> if he do thus with a few grains of modeſty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and diſtruſt of his own private judgement in reverence unto that of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority, there is little queſtion but he will ſoon be perſwaded to an active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</q> But many there be in our age who ſay, <q>They dare not do this or that which Authority injoyns, becauſe they doubt whether it be pleaſing unto God or no: <hi>but</hi> they never put the queſtion on the other hand, "How am I aſſured but my diſobedience unto Authority in this matter is my ſin, and certainly diſpleaſing unto God?
